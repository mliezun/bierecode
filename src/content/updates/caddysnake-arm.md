Our community member Miguel Liezun has shipped a fresh release of **Caddy Snake**, see the release notes for [v0.2.2](https://github.com/mliezun/caddy-snake/releases/tag/v0.2.2).

**Caddy Snake** is a Caddy plugin that lets you run Python web applications (WSGI and ASGI) directly inside the Caddy web server. It aims to make serving Python apps feel as natural and seamless as serving static files or reverse-proxying, without requiring a separate app server like Gunicorn, Uvicorn, or Daphne.

Project page: https://github.com/mliezun/caddy-snake

Quick start: install with `pip install caddysnake` (this only works on Linux x64/arm64).

This release includes binaries for arm machines.
