# Demo Days Page

The `/demo-days` page invites developers to show off their projects at our monthly meetups.
Submissions are stored in Workers KV via the `/api/demo-days` endpoint.

Fields collected:

- **Name** and **Email** so organizers can get in touch.
- **Project Name** along with a short description.
- Optional **Demo Link** if the project is accessible online.

All entries must be real, working demos—no slide decks allowed.
