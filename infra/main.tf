# Terraform configuration for Cloudflare resources used by the site
#
# This module ensures a single Workers KV namespace exists for storing
# community updates. The workflow supplies the Cloudflare API token and
# account ID, so running Terraform manually is unnecessary.
#
# The workflow persists the Terraform state file in a Workers KV namespace. This
# means Terraform always knows whether the namespace has already been created on
# previous runs. Because state is preserved, the configuration can simply create
# the namespace and Terraform will see it already exists in state on subsequent
# executions.
#
# GitHub Actions uploads the generated `terraform.tfstate` file into the
# `bierecode-updates` KV namespace after each deployment. At the start of a
# run the workflow attempts to download this file so Terraform knows about
# previously created resources. If no state file exists yet Terraform simply
# begins with an empty state and the new file is uploaded when the run
# completes.
