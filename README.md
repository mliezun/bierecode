# Bière Code Site

This project hosts the Bière Code website built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Community updates and events are managed through Cloudflare Pages Functions and a KV store.

## Features
- **Community Updates API**: `/api/updates` backed by Cloudflare KV.
- **Admin UI**: `/admin` page to submit new posts or events.
- **Public Updates List**: `/updates` page shows all posts and events.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform script in `infra/` sets up the KV namespace.
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions runs Terraform and deploys to Cloudflare Pages.

Follow the sections below for development commands from the original Astro template.

## Admin Authentication
The `/api/updates` endpoint uses HTTP Basic authentication. Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the Cloudflare environment variables or modify `wrangler.toml` for local development.

## Continuous Deployment
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site, provisions the KV namespace with Terraform, and deploys everything to Cloudflare Pages. Configure these repository secrets:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` – API token with permissions for Pages and Workers KV
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` – your Cloudflare account ID
The Terraform state file is stored in the same KV namespace between deployments. This allows Terraform to remember the namespace ID without relying on an additional backend.
The workflow runs whenever you push to `main` or update a pull request targeting `main` so you can preview infrastructure changes before merging.
On each run the workflow downloads this file before `terraform init`. If the file is missing but the namespace already exists, the workflow imports that namespace into the new state so `terraform apply` can proceed. After the run the updated state file is uploaded back to KV.
